# Who and what? 
If you want to get started with De LegitiMaat you need:
- a decision on what process that will be investigated: (the execution of which act?),
- assessors,
- documents from the public agency that is investigated,
- civil servants, experts who work in the agency to whom the assessors can ask questions
- a method to verify the answers

# Which representative choices?
Even after the selection of a process (which act is automatically executed?) it is necessary to demarcate. Investigating the entire implementation process is usually not realistic, therefor it is advised to opt for a research that is sufficiently representative.

One method to get a representative image is to focus the research within the scope of De LegitiMate on two extremes:
1. relatively easy decisions to make (determining age, for example)
2. decisions that are relatively difficult to execute (with more room for discretion, such as a right or exception that must be determined based on facts and circumstances).

# The assessors 
The assessors are people who conduct the research based on their expertise. The LegitiMate is designed for three perspectives. Therefore it is recommended that the visitation team consist of at least an auditor, lawyer and a peer IT developer. Each expertise has a specific questionnaire. The method involves first obtaining an overall image, then three different in-depth investigations and finally an overall assessment.

The LegitiMate is developed as a visitation instrument. This means that the assessors can be employees of the organization itself (phase 1) as well as external experts who are members of a visitation team (phase 2).

# The interlocutors 
In order to have the right conversation, it is necessary to have conversations with public servants who fulfill a certain role. We talk about roles instead of function names because we experienced function names vary a lot or donâ€™t have the same content. Both public servants who can explain the entire process and overall routines, and experts who can talk to one of the three types of assessors are needed.

# The entire process and overall routines
The public servant responsible for developing and managing the IT-systems that automatically execute the act.

The public servant who knows how the automated execution of the act is -legally and tehnically- connected to the automated execution of acts by other public agencies.

The public servant who knows how responses of citizens who receive decisions are used to improve the automated process.

## Developers perspective
The author of the package of requirements and/or functional design [link to glossary].

The software developer who writes code based on a set of requirements and/or functional design.

Administrator who manages the machine and application(s) on which/with the control service(s) run.

Manager dealing with Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) related matters.

## Legal perspective
The employee who can tell which principles have been made guiding by the board (for example: citizen-centric / responsible trust / excellent service / doing more with fewer people).

The rules expert.

The officer who decides which types of decisions are categorized as ejection / failure / non-slippery case [link to glossary].

The employee who can tell on which issues the decision officer [link to glossary] may overrule the system.

The legal assistant who knows how external signals (from society/politics, such as customization or working from the intention, or administrative law, such as a decision by the Council of State on proportionality or customization, and/or internal signals (such as complaints/phone calls) lead to adjustments in the development process.

The employee who knows how IT adjustments are prioritized and under which circumstances the wish for a change in an existing system is honored.

The legal assistant who is the legal representative on behalf of the administrative body.
