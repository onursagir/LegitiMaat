# The LegitiMate List of Documents 
At the start of the research it is necessary that a series of documents is available for the assessors. We have called this The LegitiMate List of Documents. This may be quite difficult, so start early. All these documents are essential to conduct the investigation:

1. The text of the act/legislation that is automatically executed.
2. The policies of the administrative agency
3. The set of decision rules that refer to the two extremes as indicated above.
4. The analysis (if applicable).
5. The functional design that refers to at least the two extremes.
6. The interaction screens (screenprints) of the website that provides the information to applicants and facilitates the interaction.
7. The letters citizens receive after their application (the administrative formal decision). 
8. The internal instructions describing the process and (manual) interventions/routines. 
9. Internal quality standards / requirements.
10. Information on reported topics (calls, complaints or objections by citizens) and the numbers (preferably over several years).
