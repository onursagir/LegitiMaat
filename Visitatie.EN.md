# The LegitiMate as a visitation instrument

# Visitation
In visitation research learning and developing is the primary focus instead of a check or audit based on supervisory authority. It exists of tools like a self-evaluation and peer appreciation or assessment.

Visitations are used in all kinds of sectors where professionals are not exactly prescribed how to work but expected to work from professional insights, for example the medical world and education. In developing the visitation aspect of The LegitiMaat, we drew inspiration from several of these assessment systems.

# How does peer visitation works?
Various scenarios for peer visitations can be found on the web; we drew from a number of them for The LegitiMate.

In principle, a visitation consists of three phases. The first phase is a self-evaluation by the organization, the second phase is a visit by an independent assessment team that speaks with those involved based on the results of the self-evaluation. Based on this, the team values ​​the organization and provides recommendations for further improvement. In the third phase, the organization implements the recommendations.

A visitation is periodically repeated. A three-year cycle seems to be the most effective and efficient. This gives room to careful preparation and implementation of the recommendations. Depending on experience, the three-year cycle can be adjusted.

The assessors in the independent assessment team are preferably civil servants of another public agency, who are directly involved in the development and application of algorithms in their organization. They can ask critical questions based on their knowledge and experience. Moreover, they may learn from the working methods and experiences of the organization they visit. It therefor works two ways. Regarding the objectivity of the assessment team, an independent chair and secretary will be provided (ie, who do not work for the agency that is reviewed/assessed.

# The three phases

## Phase 1 - Self-evaluation
The organization conducts the self-evaluation based on The LegitiMate List of Documents. and The LegitiMate Questionnaires. A coordinator divides the tasks within the assessed agency, monitors progress and checks supplied input for clarity, etc.

The start of the self-evaluation depends on when the assessment team can make the assessment visit. It can be taken as a guideline that the self-evaluation must be completed  approximately four weeks before the visit of the assessment team (see timetable in section 4). This gives the team time to prepare for the visit. It is important that at least the chair and secretary of the assessment team are known at the start of the self-evaluation. This enables agreement and planning (in an introductory meeting) on deadlines.

## Phase 2 - Visit visitation team: proof of the pudding
The visitation itself is carried out by the visitation team. The visitation team consists of the assessors with the three perspectives: legal, audit perspective and IT development perspective. We suggest 4 to 5 assessors and an independent chair and secretary. The visitation team examines to what extent the image of the organization about itself regarding the quality of the development and deployment of algorithms, corresponds to the image that the assessment team obtains based its own preparation (going through the self-evaluation and additional research).

While phase 1 focuses on obtaining documents and information about the processes, this part of the research focuses on the substantive / material outcome. Even well organized and documented processes are no guarantee that the result, the decisions and the legal protection or chain effects, are substantively in accordance with the law, the principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination.

Compare this to a driving exam; it can be checked whether the learning driver spots the mirrors and makes the necessary movements such as looking over the shoulder. The procedure can then be assessed with a ‘good’. However, this doesn’t mean the person actually sees what happens, recognizes the possible dangers in time and acts accordingly. You can only observe this by watching in practice and experience what goes right and what (almost) goes wrong.

How this part of the visitation research can best be designed depends on situation and available time. We recommend that at least the following is investigated:
1. Case law: what are the most common disputes in the field of the chosen act and processes and corresponds the resulting image to the self-evaluation?
2. Decision rules: if it is guaranteed that the decision rules form the basis of the code, it is advisable to investigate these. If the number is too large, tools to perform analysis can be tried (such as e-discovery tooling).
3. A sampling of the administrative decisions (without and in combination with objection/complaint procedures) to judge the legality.

It is also conceivable that other methods can be used, using data analysis and/or process mining or decision-mining. Future experiments with these are on our wish list.

In addition, conducting interviews with public servants is essential. This concerns employees with roles and functions selected by the members of the visitation team. 

No fixed standard is given for the time required; Depending on the size and structure of the organisation, one or more days can be scheduled for the visitation.

After the visit (or visits), the visitation team prepares a preliminary report with findings and recommendations on all components of The LegitiMate. Recommendations based on the findings are explicitly focused on the positive points (appreciation) and improvement (learning) aspects.

The visitation team discusses the report with the organization's MT. For example, an oral explanation can be given and the organization can respond (principle of hearing both sides). The report is finalized.

## Fase 3 - Uitvoering van de aanbevelingen
De organisatie maakt een implementatieplan voor de gedane aanbevelingen. Hierin worden acties voor uitbouw of bestendiging van positieve punten opgenomen en acties ter opvolging van verbeterpunten. De acties worden van een concrete realisatietermijn voorzien, zodat zij in een volgende visitatie kunnen worden meegenomen.

## Phase 3 - Implementation of the recommendations
The public agency designs an implementation plan. This includes actions for expanding or consolidating positive points and actions to follow up improvement aspects. The to-do-list is provided with a concrete realization period, so that they can be included in a subsequent visitation research.
