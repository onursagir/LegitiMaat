  <section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Public administration has many different public tasks. These tasks are assigned by a specific act to a specific public agency. Some of these legal tasks are automatically executed. In those cases algorithms are used. We call it ADM, Automated Decision Making. This is the process leading to legally binding results; administrative decisions in individual cases. ADM is used to impose fines for speeding, reclaim allowances or to grant state pension or child benefits. As with a more visible performance of public tasks such as building dikes, it is important to know how these activities contribute to the designated task and which choices have been made. Automated execution of legislation is a public activity too. It must therefore be legitimate and open for review.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate is an assessment tool to provide insight into and assess the automated execution of legislation by the public administration in a standardized way. The LegitiMate is based on three perspectives: legal, development and audit/ accounting perspective.</p>
<p>The project is the first attempt to get a common understanding of the daily and sometimes long existing use of algorithms by public administration. We are talking about systems that are programmed in COBOL. We understand that the word “algorithms” nowadays is often used in relation to Machine Learning (ML). This is however not the focus of this instrument. The LegitiMate is designed for knowledge-based algorithms (preprogrammed) used for automatically execution of legislation leading to an individual administrative legal decision.</p>
<p><em>The scope of The LegitiMate</em></p>
<p>The LegitiMate covers the entire process from the publicantion of an Act to an individual decision, the response of the recipients (phone calls, complaints, objections) and the chain effects (the transfer of the decision as data to third party decision recipients). It is necessary that this process becomes more transparent. Another aim of the The LegitiMate is to enable research or judgements on whether the legislation, the general principles of good governance and the prohibition of discrimination have been complied with.</p>
<p><em>The development of The LegitiMate</em></p>
<p>Experts developed The LegitiMate on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. This project was experimental and made with support from two public agencies that are using ADM for years, National ombudsman and several governmental institutions with knowledge of IT development. In the slipstream of the project scientific research was facilitated on related topics for master students.</p>
<p><em>Elements of the LegitiMate</em></p>
<p>The LegitiMate contains an analysis of the usual steps taken in public agencies. This is the “process map”.</p>
<p>Based on the process map we constructed “The LegitiMate List of Documents”. An inventory of documents required for the investigation.</p>
<p>Next we produced 3 questionnaires that are more or less based on the several steps mentioned in the “process map”. They are designed for each of the 3 perspectives. The questionnaires can be answered by the agency itself.</p>
<p>The third element is a description of the necessary steps to conduct the visitation research based on the information and answers.</p>
<p>With The LegitiMate we bring daily practice, technology and law one step closer together.</p>

<p>Public administrations have many different tasks. These tasks are assigned by an act to a specific public agency. Some of these legal tasks are automatically executed. In those cases algorithms are used. For example, imposing fines for speeding, reclaiming allowances or granting state pension or child benefit. As with a more visible execution of public tasks such as building dikes, it is important to know how these activities contribute to the designated task and which choices have been made. Automated execution of legislation is a public activity too and must therefore be legitimate.</p>
<p>While in literature the concept of “digital discretion” is elaborated, in practice Dutch public administration isn’t obliged to show and tell how the buzzing IT-systems are designed and how the design and use is in accordance with the legislation, principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination. This explains why up to today public agencies are barely aware of the legal and other aspects of these routines. With The LegitiMate, the executive branch of the government can be held accountable. It facilitates as well that external reviewers can form an opinion of the choices and system the public administration has (let) developed and implemented. The LegitiMate is intended to assess in a way that the administration can develop and improve. It is a visitation research tool. </p>
<section id="who-is-the-legitimate-for"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x1-1-1-who-is-the-legitimate-for"><bdi class="secno">1.1.1 </bdi>Who is The LegitiMate for?</h4><a class="self-link" href="#who-is-the-legitimate-for" aria-label="Permalink for Section 1.1.1"></a></div>
<p>The LegitiMate is a method to understand and assess the automated execution of legislation by public administration in a standardized manner. The LegitiMate is based on both the highly specialized professionalism of the employees of the administrative agencies, and the increasing demand in society for public administration to be accountable for ever growing automation.</p>
<p>It is intended for public agencies that automatically execute legislation and make individual administrative decisions (ADM). With The Legitimate the agency can show the internal productions, the relevant steps and safe guards. It will probably lead to self-assessments and better understanding at management level of the range of responsibilities. The agency can also invite a visitation team with assessors from other public agencies to conduct research. With the result, the agency is provided with recommendations.</p>
<p>When new IT systems are being developed, the agency can immediately see what documents are needed in order to provide (external) insight.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate is also intended for assessors: the lawyers, auditors and fellow IT developers who need meaningful information on how the legislation is automatically executed.</p>

<p>On July 1, 2022, the Dutch prototype was presented to the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and published on GitHub. The working method has been developed, tested and adapted in a few sprints.

<p>The LegitiMate is based on the principles of visitation research. It is a visitation tool. Large parts of the research are delegated to the expert, the public agency.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate indicates the necessary documents; The LegitiMate List of Documents. Another part of the LegitiMate are the three questionnaires that need to be answered by the administrative agency: The LegitiMate Questionnaires.</p>
<p>Once the answers and documents are collected, the visitation team will start its investigation by conducting interviews and audit sampling.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate is an important first step towards transparency and accountability for the use of algorithms in automated execution of legislation.</p>

<p>Auditors and assessors each have their own professional frame work and focus points when they want to assess the automated execution of legislation. We figured that it should be possible to align at least three disciplines to get a more holistic approach. On the other hand we try to help public agencies by standardizing the set of documents and questionnaires so they are not all asked to invent the wheel.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate is meant as an holistic method facilitating three disciplines in assessing automated execution in different types of public agencies.</p>
<p>With The LegitiMate:</p>
<ul>
<li>a legal expert can judge the legitimacy of the automated execution including compliance with the right to good administration and prohibition of discrimination,</li>
<li>an information expert can judge the quality of the automated implementation,</li>
<li>an accountant or internal controller can judge the financial legitimacy of the automated execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Netherlands a lot is happening regarding the use of algorithms by the public administration. For example, members of the Parliament voted in favour of a National Algorithm register for public agencies and the government has an open source policy.</p>
<p>Also, increasing attention is paid on the supervision of the use of algorithms. However, supervisory activity is only possible if the public agency itself has insight into its own complex and highly technical (legal) processes.</p>

<p>When public administration makes administrative decisions in individual cases involving large numbers and many comparable repetitive tasks, this process often is automated. To enable this the particular act/legislation needs to be translated and choices must be made to decide how the legislation will be implemented. After discussions with several experts in different agencies working on these translations and implementation we distinguished this process in the following steps.</p>
<p><figure id="fig-processen-wetsuitvoering"><img src="media/processen-wetsuitvoering.png" alt="Processen wetsuitvoering" title="Processen wetsuitvoering" height="4500" width="8000"><figcaption>Figure <bdi class="figno">1</bdi> <span class="fig-title">Processen wetsuitvoering</span></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This process map is an illustration, not a prescription. All public agencies have their own practices, internal traditions and work flows. This will remain. The process map and the several stages we describe and use in The LegitiMate are a means to an end: a dialogue.</p>
<section id="automated-decisions-or-decision-support-systems"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x1-3-1-automated-decisions-or-decision-support-systems"><bdi class="secno">1.3.1 </bdi>Automated decisions or decision support systems?</h4><a class="self-link" href="#automated-decisions-or-decision-support-systems" aria-label="Permalink for Section 1.3.1"></a></div>
<p>The LegitiMate is designed to assess the automated execution of legislation by public agencies. In literature on ADM its very common to distinguish easy from hard cases. This difference can be witnessed in practice too. To understand the internal routines its necessary to discuss the commonly used difference in easy and hard cases.</p>
<p>Easy cases are processed without human intervention: the decision is made automatically.</p>
<p>A minority of cases is partly handled with human intervention (hard cases / /dropouts/ejected).  In these cases the algorithms perform as decision support systems.</p>
<p>The public administration uses selection or prioritization methods to distinguish cases in those who lead to fully automated decisions and those that need human judgments and therefor are partially automated. By applying selection rules (sometimes multi staged / in several rounds to match available staff capacity), the case can be assigned to a public servant for processing. The latter may request additional information or carry out additional checks resulting in a decision made in collaboration with the machine. In the legal perspective, we call this the preparatory acts.</p>

<p>Judging the legitimacy of computerized actions requires a bridge or connection (interface) between the code the machine uses and the legal resources that dictate what the machine is supposed to do.</p>
<p>The code used for computers is a good language for software developers, but not for many other people. Lawyers are good at understanding the meaning of legal sources. This is often difficult for non-lawyers. In a multidisciplinary group, a common language is needed to understand the meaning of legal sources and the way in which they should be incorporated into code.</p>
<p>Many public agencies use a rule-based solution for this; think of different methods for creating business rules and decision models. This is a language of algorithms in the form of 'rules' in a language that can be understood by both man and machine. We call these decision and calculation rules.</p>
<p>Our goal with The LegitiMate is to find a common language / method to describe both the quality of interpretation of legal resources and the coding of algorithms. By doing so internal discussion and/or external testing is enable, leading to improvement of the quality of algorithms.</p>
</section><section id="on-algorithms-and-source-code"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x1-3-3-on-algorithms-and-source-code"><bdi class="secno">1.3.3 </bdi>On algorithms and source code</h4><a class="self-link" href="#on-algorithms-and-source-code" aria-label="Permalink for Section 1.3.3"></a></div>
<p>Ultimately, algorithms are converted into computer code: the source code.</p>
</section><section id="the-scope-of-the-legitimate"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x1-3-4-the-scope-of-the-legitimate"><bdi class="secno">1.3.4 </bdi>The scope of The LegitiMate</h4><a class="self-link" href="#the-scope-of-the-legitimate" aria-label="Permalink for Section 1.3.4"></a></div>
<p>The LegitiMate covers the entire process from act to individual administrative decision and afterwards, the response of the citizens (telephone calls, complaints, objections) and the chain effects / propagation.</p>
<p>It is made for the automated execution of legislation by the public agencies using knowledge-based algorithms.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based algorithms use rules for making calculations, solving a problem, answering a question, or making a decision.
The rules we are talking about can be divided into different types: decision rules (with which you test variables for true/false, and then arrive at a decision) and calculation rules (with which you make a sum with those variables). There are many more, although they may also be classified as subcategories of these two.</p>
<p>If it has to be determined whether an applicant falls under a certain category (e.g. “partner”), you also run through a number of variables in the definition of partner, and actually make a decision about that. After this you take the result of this into account in a subsequent decision (e.g. about entitlement to a supplement). We could also call that a classification rule.</p>
<p>Selection rules determine which decisions must be taken (partly) by a human civil servant. Sometimes these are rules are preprogrammed (such as 'all cases in which applicants provide an address other than that is officially registered) and sometimes statistical algorithms are used.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate therefore isn’t (yet) suitable for accounting for or assessing the use of statistical algorithms, including machine learning that make taxations about the probability of an outcome based on statistical analysis of data from the past. This may be addressed later.</p>

<p>Within public administration, many personal data and systems are interconnected. This means that both the input (data) and the result (a decision) have relationships with other processes, other domains, other laws and other agencies. Providing insight into these relationships and assessing whether this implementation is in accordance with the law, principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination is also part of The LegitiMate.</p>

<p>A lot of documentation is needed to assess the legitimacy of the systems. Public administration is responsible for the correct interpretation of legislation and compliance with general principles of good administration. This doesn’t alter if it is not developed by public servants but purchased or commissioned. In case the documentation cannot be made available by the supplier or if the supplier refuses to do so due to intellectual property rights, The LegitiMate cannot be used. It will of course have implications regarding the accountability of the public administration.</p>

<p>In visitation research learning and developing is the primary focus instead of a check or audit based on supervisory authority. It exists of tools like a self-evaluation and peer appreciation or assessment.</p>
<p>Visitations are used in all kinds of sectors where professionals are not exactly prescribed how to work but expected to work from professional insights, for example the medical world and education. In developing the visitation aspect of The LegitiMaat, we drew inspiration from several of these assessment systems.</p>
</section><section id="how-does-peer-visitation-works"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="x2-2-how-does-peer-visitation-works"><bdi class="secno">2.2 </bdi>How does peer visitation works?</h3><a class="self-link" href="#how-does-peer-visitation-works" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.2"></a></div>
<p>Various scenarios for peer visitations can be found on the web; we drew from a number of them for The LegitiMate.</p>
<p>In principle, a visitation consists of three phases. The first phase is a self-evaluation by the organization, the second phase is a visit by an independent assessment team that speaks with those involved based on the results of the self-evaluation. Based on this, the team values ​​the organization and provides recommendations for further improvement. In the third phase, the organization implements the recommendations.</p>
<p>A visitation is periodically repeated. A three-year cycle seems to be the most effective and efficient. This gives room to careful preparation and implementation of the recommendations. Depending on experience, the three-year cycle can be adjusted.</p>
<p>The assessors in the independent assessment team are preferably civil servants of another public agency, who are directly involved in the development and application of algorithms in their organization. They can ask critical questions based on their knowledge and experience. Moreover, they may learn from the working methods and experiences of the organization they visit. It therefor works two ways. Regarding the objectivity of the assessment team, an independent chair and secretary will be provided (ie, who do not work for the agency that is reviewed/assessed.</p>
</section><section id="the-three-phases"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="x2-3-the-three-phases"><bdi class="secno">2.3 </bdi>The three phases</h3><a class="self-link" href="#the-three-phases" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.3"></a></div>

<p>The organization conducts the self-evaluation based on The LegitiMate List of Documents. and The LegitiMate Questionnaires. A coordinator divides the tasks within the assessed agency, monitors progress and checks supplied input for clarity, etc.</p>
<p>The start of the self-evaluation depends on when the assessment team can make the assessment visit. It can be taken as a guideline that the self-evaluation must be completed  approximately four weeks before the visit of the assessment team (see timetable in section 4). This gives the team time to prepare for the visit. It is important that at least the chair and secretary of the assessment team are known at the start of the self-evaluation. This enables agreement and planning (in an introductory meeting) on deadlines.</p>
</section><section id="phase-2-visit-visitation-team-proof-of-the-pudding"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-3-2-phase-2-visit-visitation-team-proof-of-the-pudding"><bdi class="secno">2.3.2 </bdi>Phase 2 - Visit visitation team: proof of the pudding</h4><a class="self-link" href="#phase-2-visit-visitation-team-proof-of-the-pudding" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.3.2"></a></div>
<p>The visitation itself is carried out by the visitation team. The visitation team consists of the assessors with the three perspectives: legal, audit perspective and IT development perspective. We suggest 4 to 5 assessors and an independent chair and secretary. The visitation team examines to what extent the image of the organization about itself regarding the quality of the development and deployment of algorithms, corresponds to the image that the assessment team obtains based its own preparation (going through the self-evaluation and additional research).</p>
<p>While phase 1 focuses on obtaining documents and information about the processes, this part of the research focuses on the substantive / material outcome. Even well organized and documented processes are no guarantee that the result, the decisions and the legal protection or chain effects, are substantively in accordance with the law, the principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination.</p>
<p>Compare this to a driving exam; it can be checked whether the learning driver spots the mirrors and makes the necessary movements such as looking over the shoulder. The procedure can then be assessed with a ‘good’. However, this doesn’t mean the person actually sees what happens, recognizes the possible dangers in time and acts accordingly. You can only observe this by watching in practice and experience what goes right and what (almost) goes wrong.</p>
<p>How this part of the visitation research can best be designed depends on situation and available time. We recommend that at least the following is investigated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Case law: what are the most common disputes in the field of the chosen act and processes and corresponds the resulting image to the self-evaluation?</li>
<li>Decision rules: if it is guaranteed that the decision rules form the basis of the code, it is advisable to investigate these. If the number is too large, tools to perform analysis can be tried (such as e-discovery tooling).</li>
<li>A sampling of the administrative decisions (without and in combination with objection/complaint procedures) to judge the legality.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also conceivable that other methods can be used, using data analysis and/or process mining or decision-mining. Future experiments with these are on our wish list.</p>
<p>In addition, conducting interviews with public servants is essential. This concerns employees with roles and functions selected by the members of the visitation team. </p>
<p>No fixed standard is given for the time required; Depending on the size and structure of the organisation, one or more days can be scheduled for the visitation.</p>
<p>After the visit (or visits), the visitation team prepares a preliminary report with findings and recommendations on all components of The LegitiMate. Recommendations based on the findings are explicitly focused on the positive points (appreciation) and improvement (learning) aspects.</p>
<p>The visitation team discusses the report with the organization's MT. For example, an oral explanation can be given and the organization can respond (principle of hearing both sides). The report is finalized.</p>

<p>If you want to get started with De LegitiMaat you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a decision on what process that will be investigated: (the execution of which act?),</li>
<li>assessors,</li>
<li>documents from the public agency that is investigated,</li>
<li>civil servants, experts who work in the agency to whom the assessors can ask questions</li>
<li>a method to verify the answers</li>
</ul>

<p>Even after the selection of a process (which act is automatically executed?) it is necessary to demarcate. Investigating the entire implementation process is usually not realistic, therefor it is advised to opt for a research that is sufficiently representative.</p>
<p>One method to get a representative image is to focus the research within the scope of De LegitiMate on two extremes:</p>
<ol>
<li>relatively easy decisions to make (determining age, for example)</li>
<li>decisions that are relatively difficult to execute (with more room for discretion, such as a right or exception that must be determined based on facts and circumstances).</li>
</ol>

<p>The assessors are people who conduct the research based on their expertise. The LegitiMate is designed for three perspectives. Therefore it is recommended that the visitation team consist of at least an auditor, lawyer and a peer IT developer. Each expertise has a specific questionnaire. The method involves first obtaining an overall image, then three different in-depth investigations and finally an overall assessment.</p>
<p>The LegitiMate is developed as a visitation instrument. This means that the assessors can be employees of the organization itself (phase 1) as well as external experts who are members of a visitation team (phase 2).</p>

<p>In order to have the right conversation, it is necessary to have conversations with public servants who fulfill a certain role. We talk about roles instead of function names because we experienced function names vary a lot or don’t have the same content. Both public servants who can explain the entire process and overall routines, and experts who can talk to one of the three types of assessors are needed.</p>

<p>The public servant responsible for developing and managing the IT-systems that automatically execute the act.</p>
<p>The public servant who knows how the automated execution of the act is -legally and tehnically- connected to the automated execution of acts by other public agencies.</p>
<p>The public servant who knows how responses of citizens who receive decisions are used to improve the automated process.</p>

<p>At the start of the research it is necessary that a series of documents is available for the assessors. We have called this The LegitiMate List of Documents. This may be quite difficult, so start early. All these documents are essential to conduct the investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The text of the act/legislation that is automatically executed.</li>
<li>The policies of the administrative agency</li>
<li>The set of decision rules that refer to the two extremes as indicated above.</li>
<li>The analysis (if applicable).</li>
<li>The functional design that refers to at least the two extremes.</li>
<li>The interaction screens (screenprints) of the website that provides the information to applicants and facilitates the interaction.</li>
<li>The letters citizens receive after their application (the administrative formal decision). </li>
<li>The internal instructions describing the process and (manual) interventions/routines. </li>

<p><dfn id="dfn-abbb" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">ABBB</dfn> the General principles of good governance (**un)written rules that the government and civil servants must adhere to when acting and making decisions.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-algorithm" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Algorithm</dfn> A procedure or set of rules used in calculating and solving problems; a precisely defined set of mathematical or logical operations to perform a particular task.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-algorithm-register" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Algorithm Register</dfn> A facility in which a collection of algorithms used is made public.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-auditor" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Auditor</dfn> someone who is professionally involved in auditing an organization according to a fixed method.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-awb" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Awb</dfn> General Administrative Law Act. A law that contains the general rules for the relationship between the government and the citizen.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-policy-rules" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Policy rules</dfn> Pursuant to Article 4:81(1) of the Awb, an administrative body may adopt policy rules with regard to a power vested in it or exercised under its responsibility or delegated by it.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-room-for-assessment" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Room for assessment</dfn> Because the law never prescribes exactly what must be done in all cases, an administrative body usually has discretion when applying general rules in individual circumstances. The administrative body makes use of this space in the implementation, so also in an automated implementation.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-range-of-the-legitimaat" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Range of the LegitiMaat</dfn> The LegitiMaat covers the entire process from law to individual decision and afterwards, the response of the recipients (phone calls, complaints, objections).</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-decision-officer" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Decision officer</dfn> The official who is authorized to decide in an individual case.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-decision-rules" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Decision rules</dfn> the method used to test variables for true/false, after which a decision is made.</p>
<p><dfn data-lt="Source code|Source code (source code)|source code" id="dfn-source-code" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Source code (source code)</dfn> the original text from which the software originates. This is programmer readable text and contains the program instructions on how the code's functionality works.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-decision-mining" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Decision mining</dfn> technique whereby on the basis of the results, the decisions, it is possible to analyze which routines were used to make the decisions.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-discretionary-power" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Discretionary power</dfn> In the case of a discretionary power, the legislator has granted the administrative authority a power to determine to a certain extent itself which decision is taken (policy space). Since 2022, the administrative court has assessed the use of this space in an incriminating (disadvantageous) decision for the citizen in a more intrusive way against the proportionality principle of 3:4 of the Awb. In the context of automated enforcement of laws, it is said that this is especially suitable for legislation with limited powers. This means that the statutory provisions dictate what the board must decide.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-functional-design" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Functional design</dfn> Here all requirements and wishes that a product must meet are collected and ordered. It is described in what way, what expectations the user has, which actions he performs and what results they produce.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-information-technology-infrastructure-library-itil" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</dfn> developed a reference framework for setting up management processes within an ICT organization.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-intercoder-reliability" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Intercoder reliability</dfn> In the context of quantitative research, intercoder reliability is the extent to which 2 different researchers agree on coding the same content. It ensures that when multiple researchers encode a set of data, they come to the same conclusions.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-interdisciplinary" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Interdisciplinary</dfn> the integration of insights from multiple fields (disciplines).</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-internal-controller" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Internal controller</dfn> employee in charge of monitoring and controlling business processes.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-chain-effects" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Chain effects</dfn> Many data and systems are connected within government. This means that both the input (data) and the result (a decision) have relationships with other processes, other fields of work, other laws and other authorities. Providing insight into these relationships and assessing whether this implementation is in accordance with the law, ABBB and the prohibition of discrimination is also part of De LegitiMaat.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-machine-learning" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Machine learning</dfn> A machine learning (ML) algorithm must be trained with a dataset. Training means that the ML algorithm analyzes this dataset and learns to recognize patterns and correlations in this dataset. After training, the ML algorithm is able to apply the learned patterns and correlations to a new (unknown) dataset. Typically, ML algorithms need to be trained on large amounts of data before they can recognize accurate patterns and correlations.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-open-source-policy" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Open source policy</dfn> policy stipulating that the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#dfn-source-code" class="internalDFN" id="ref-for-dfn-source-code-1">source code</a> is freely available. Anyone can read, modify and distribute the source code.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-process-mining" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Process mining</dfn> technique of using event logs in applications to visualize and analyze processes. It is an objective, fact-based tool to analyze and improve processes.</p>
<p><dfn data-lt="Process representatives|Process representative" id="dfn-process-representatives" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Process representatives</dfn> people who represent the administrative body in appeal or appeal to the administrative court.</p>
<p><dfn data-lt="Lawfulness|Lawful|Lawful decisions" id="dfn-lawfulness" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Lawfulness</dfn> It is customary in government to make a distinction between legal legitimacy and financial legitimacy in the context of auditing and accountability. The legal concept of legality covers all applicable laws and regulations. It is assessed whether the actions are in accordance with these laws and regulations. The concept of legality that is used by the accountant for the government is more limited. Then there is a direct relationship with financial management. In the LegitiMaat we therefore always indicate which form of legality we mean.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-rules-expert" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Rules expert</dfn> employee who translates laws into rules.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-calculation-rules" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Calculation rules</dfn> rules with which a sum is made with the variables</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-repository" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Repository</dfn> an ICT/architecture term for a repository or warehouse.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-selection-rules" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Selection rules</dfn> Selection rules can be used to select which matters are handled automatically and which must be viewed by an employee.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-software-developer" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Software developer</dfn> a person who is involved in software programming. A software developer is also known as a programmer, computer programmer or application developer.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-statistical-algorithms" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Statistical algorithms</dfn> A statistical algorithm is an ML algorithm that makes a prediction for new data based on training data. This prediction is a probability calculation and represents the probability that a certain situation will occur. This can be based on data from the past, but also on data from comparable situations.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-implementation-policy" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Implementation policy</dfn> Consistent line of conduct that is laid down in internal work instructions and that determines how certain cases are handled and how the discretion is filled.</p>
<p><dfn data-lt="Discharge|Not smooth case|Discharge/failure/non-slippery case" id="dfn-discharge" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Discharge/failure/non-slippery case</dfn> In the case of automated enforcement of laws, it is common to determine which cases are handled fully automatically and which cases are handled by an employee should be looked at more closely. This determination is sometimes done on the basis of <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#dfn-selection-rules" class="internalDFN" id="ref-for-dfn-selection-rules-1">selection rules</a>.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-validate" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Validate</dfn> Declare something valid.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-verify" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Verify</dfn> Check if something is correct.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-annulled" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Annulled</dfn> If a decision is known to the citizen, the citizen can object within 6 weeks. If the citizen is in the right, the decision is sometimes annulled: it no longer exists legally. The judge can also annul the decision. A decision is therefore not final during at least six weeks. If an objection has been lodged, the decision will not be finalized in court until the decision on the objection has been taken. Or until the judge has ruled.</p>
<p><dfn id="dfn-preparatory-actions" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog" data-dfn-type="dfn">Preparatory actions</dfn> Under the General Administrative Law Act, an application leads to a decision. Preparatory actions are being taken to arrive at this decision. Part of the process that is tested with De LegitiMaat coincides with these preparatory actions.</p>
