# Auditors perspective Questionnaire

1. How is algorithm management organized? Which departments are involved in the process of developing or modifying an algorithm?
2. Who is the 'owner' of the algorithm within the administration: who has primary control over the development of new algorithms and changes to existing algorithms?
3. How is the development or modification of algorithms in the manufacturing process documented (recording traces to sources, choices made, interpretations, etc.)?
4. How is the algorithm development process recorded and documented?
5. How was the choice for development methodology and supporting applications made?
6. Has a central repository (repository) for algorithms been set up and how is it managed?
7. Are the algorithms tested to ensure financially legitimate decisions and how? (LINK glossary)?
8. How are the algorithms handed over from developer to owner? How is discharge granted for the correct execution of the development or change assignment?
9. What architectures include the development and modification of algorithms and what procedures enable a compliancy check.  
10. How are the results of the application of the algorithms recorded for the purpose of evaluating (side) effects?
