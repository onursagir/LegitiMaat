Public administration has many different public tasks. These tasks are assigned by a specific act to a specific public agency. Some of these legal tasks are automatically executed. In those cases algorithms are used. We call it ADM, Automated Decision Making. This is the process leading to legally binding results; administrative decisions in individual cases. ADM is used to impose fines for speeding, reclaim allowances or to grant state pension or child benefits. As with a more visible performance of public tasks such as building dikes, it is important to know how these activities contribute to the designated task and which choices have been made. Automated execution of legislation is a public activity too. It must therefore be legitimate and open for review.

The LegitiMate is an assessment tool to provide insight into and assess the automated execution of legislation by the public administration in a standardized way. The LegitiMate is based on three perspectives: legal, development and audit/ accounting perspective.

The project is the first attempt to get a common understanding of the daily and sometimes long existing use of algorithms by public administration. We are talking about systems that are programmed in COBOL. We understand that the word “algorithms” nowadays is often used in relation to Machine Learning (ML). This is however not the focus of this instrument. The LegitiMate is designed for knowledge-based algorithms (preprogrammed) used for automatically execution of legislation leading to an individual administrative legal decision.

_The scope of The LegitiMate_

The LegitiMate covers the entire process from the publicantion of an Act to an individual decision, the response of the recipients (phone calls, complaints, objections) and the chain effects (the transfer of the decision as data to third party decision recipients). It is necessary that this process becomes more transparent. Another aim of the The LegitiMate is to enable research or judgements on whether the legislation, the general principles of good governance and the prohibition of discrimination have been complied with.

_The development of The LegitiMate_

Experts developed The LegitiMate on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. This project was experimental and made with support from two public agencies that are using ADM for years, National ombudsman and several governmental institutions with knowledge of IT development. In the slipstream of the project scientific research was facilitated on related topics for master students.

_Elements of the LegitiMate_

The LegitiMate contains an analysis of the usual steps taken in public agencies. This is the “process map”.

Based on the process map we constructed “The LegitiMate List of Documents”. An inventory of documents required for the investigation.

Next we produced 3 questionnaires that are more or less based on the several steps mentioned in the “process map”. They are designed for each of the 3 perspectives. The questionnaires can be answered by the agency itself.

The third element is a description of the necessary steps to conduct the visitation research based on the information and answers.

With The LegitiMate we bring daily practice, technology and law one step closer together.
