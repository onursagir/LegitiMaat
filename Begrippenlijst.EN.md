# Glossary

<dfn>ABBB</dfn> the General principles of good governance (**un)written rules that the government and civil servants must adhere to when acting and making decisions.

<dfn>Algorithm</dfn> A procedure or set of rules used in calculating and solving problems; a precisely defined set of mathematical or logical operations to perform a particular task.

<dfn>Algorithm Register</dfn> A facility in which a collection of algorithms used is made public.

<dfn>Auditor</dfn> someone who is professionally involved in auditing an organization according to a fixed method.

<dfn>Awb</dfn> General Administrative Law Act. A law that contains the general rules for the relationship between the government and the citizen.

<dfn>Policy rules</dfn> Pursuant to Article 4:81(1) of the Awb, an administrative body may adopt policy rules with regard to a power vested in it or exercised under its responsibility or delegated by it.

<dfn>Room for assessment</dfn> Because the law never prescribes exactly what must be done in all cases, an administrative body usually has discretion when applying general rules in individual circumstances. The administrative body makes use of this space in the implementation, so also in an automated implementation.

<dfn>Range of the LegitiMaat</dfn> The LegitiMaat covers the entire process from law to individual decision and afterwards, the response of the recipients (phone calls, complaints, objections).

<dfn>Decision officer</dfn> The official who is authorized to decide in an individual case.

<dfn>Decision rules</dfn> the method used to test variables for true/false, after which a decision is made.

<dfn data-lt="Source code|Source code (source code)|source code">Source code (source code)</dfn> the original text from which the software originates. This is programmer readable text and contains the program instructions on how the code's functionality works.

<dfn>Decision mining</dfn> technique whereby on the basis of the results, the decisions, it is possible to analyze which routines were used to make the decisions.

<dfn>Discretionary power</dfn> In the case of a discretionary power, the legislator has granted the administrative authority a power to determine to a certain extent itself which decision is taken (policy space). Since 2022, the administrative court has assessed the use of this space in an incriminating (disadvantageous) decision for the citizen in a more intrusive way against the proportionality principle of 3:4 of the Awb. In the context of automated enforcement of laws, it is said that this is especially suitable for legislation with limited powers. This means that the statutory provisions dictate what the board must decide.

<dfn>Functional design</dfn> Here all requirements and wishes that a product must meet are collected and ordered. It is described in what way, what expectations the user has, which actions he performs and what results they produce.

<dfn>Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</dfn> developed a reference framework for setting up management processes within an ICT organization.

<dfn>Intercoder reliability</dfn> In the context of quantitative research, intercoder reliability is the extent to which 2 different researchers agree on coding the same content. It ensures that when multiple researchers encode a set of data, they come to the same conclusions.

<dfn>Interdisciplinary</dfn> the integration of insights from multiple fields (disciplines).

<dfn>Internal controller</dfn> employee in charge of monitoring and controlling business processes.

<dfn>Chain effects</dfn> Many data and systems are connected within government. This means that both the input (data) and the result (a decision) have relationships with other processes, other fields of work, other laws and other authorities. Providing insight into these relationships and assessing whether this implementation is in accordance with the law, ABBB and the prohibition of discrimination is also part of De LegitiMaat.

<dfn>Machine learning</dfn> A machine learning (ML) algorithm must be trained with a dataset. Training means that the ML algorithm analyzes this dataset and learns to recognize patterns and correlations in this dataset. After training, the ML algorithm is able to apply the learned patterns and correlations to a new (unknown) dataset. Typically, ML algorithms need to be trained on large amounts of data before they can recognize accurate patterns and correlations.

<dfn>Open source policy</dfn> policy stipulating that the [=source code=] is freely available. Anyone can read, modify and distribute the source code.

<dfn>Process mining</dfn> technique of using event logs in applications to visualize and analyze processes. It is an objective, fact-based tool to analyze and improve processes.

<dfn data-lt="Process representatives|Process representative">Process representatives</dfn> people who represent the administrative body in appeal or appeal to the administrative court.

<dfn data-lt="Lawfulness|Lawful|Lawful decisions">Lawfulness</dfn> It is customary in government to make a distinction between legal legitimacy and financial legitimacy in the context of auditing and accountability. The legal concept of legality covers all applicable laws and regulations. It is assessed whether the actions are in accordance with these laws and regulations. The concept of legality that is used by the accountant for the government is more limited. Then there is a direct relationship with financial management. In the LegitiMaat we therefore always indicate which form of legality we mean.

<dfn>Rules expert</dfn> employee who translates laws into rules.

<dfn>Calculation rules</dfn> rules with which a sum is made with the variables

<dfn>Repository</dfn> an ICT/architecture term for a repository or warehouse.

<dfn>Selection rules</dfn> Selection rules can be used to select which matters are handled automatically and which must be viewed by an employee.

<dfn>Software developer</dfn> a person who is involved in software programming. A software developer is also known as a programmer, computer programmer or application developer.

<dfn>Statistical algorithms</dfn> A statistical algorithm is an ML algorithm that makes a prediction for new data based on training data. This prediction is a probability calculation and represents the probability that a certain situation will occur. This can be based on data from the past, but also on data from comparable situations.

<dfn>Implementation policy</dfn> Consistent line of conduct that is laid down in internal work instructions and that determines how certain cases are handled and how the discretion is filled.

<dfn data-lt="Discharge|Discharge|Not smooth case">Discharge/failure/non-slippery case</dfn> In the case of automated enforcement of laws, it is common to determine which cases are handled fully automatically and which cases are handled by an employee should be looked at more closely. This determination is sometimes done on the basis of [=selection rules=].

<dfn>Validate</dfn> Declare something valid.

<dfn>Verify</dfn> Check if something is correct.

<dfn>Annulled</dfn> If a decision is known to the citizen, the citizen can object within 6 weeks. If the citizen is in the right, the decision is sometimes annulled: it no longer exists legally. The judge can also annul the decision. A decision is therefore not final during at least six weeks. If an objection has been lodged, the decision will not be finalized in court until the decision on the objection has been taken. Or until the judge has ruled.

<dfn>Preparatory actions</dfn> Under the General Administrative Law Act, an application leads to a decision. Preparatory actions are being taken to arrive at this decision. Part of the process that is tested with De LegitiMaat coincides with these preparatory actions.
