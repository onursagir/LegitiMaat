# Developers Perspective Questionnaire

## Analysis 
1. Is there a detailed description of the current functioning of the (primary) process, where relevant, a description of the problem to be solved and its scope? Is the problem owner (the person responsible for the problem area) known?
2. What should be achieved with the proposed change, if possible expressed in terms of improvement of legitimacy, efficiency, citizen satisfaction and employee satisfaction?
3. Which user and/or policy scenarios are considered (sufficiently) representative to asses whether all principles / preconditions / principles / etc. are met? Take into account the whole range of the application and how the project promotor wishes to communicate about this: both in the solution(s) itself (ie business operations) and about the solution(s).

| Asses scenarios combined with communication policy. | This is an example<br/>A.<br/>B.<br/>C.<br/>D.<br/>E. |

## Decision Rules 
Describes the mapping of the entire set of decision rules to the asses scenarios formulated in the analysis. It is clear for each scenario which decision rule set(s) is relevant for that specific scenario.

## Functional design
Special attention is paid to the place(s) where the functionalities with which the user and policy scenarios are supported and implemented in the analysis above are described.
1. Is that (it/a) Functional Design? Or does the administration has another routine? 
2.  Which FDs does the administration know? Examples:
- general functional design
- logical data model
- human machine interface
- functional input process
- functional output process
3. How are changes compared to previous version(s) tracked?
4. If decisions are made that affect the functional design, that decision is preferably documented. Is that visible?
5. Describes the mapping of the entire set of test cases to the decision rules. It is clear for each decision rule set which test cases are relevant for that specific decision rule set.

| Mapping decision rules on Asses scenarios. | This is an example<br/>Set 1 has test cases 01..07.<br/>Set 2 has test cases 08..11.<br/>Test scenario E lacks test cases because there is no fit with the decision rules set. |

## Code
Describes the used Git workflow for CI/CD and the corresponding version management of asses scenarios, decision rule sets and test cases. Also explains what the used test strategy is. Has the KPIs / reporting items of the process assessment and testing (BiSL).

## Digital Interaction 
Explains separately for each individual assess scenario how the digital interaction takes place and which internal working instructions.

## Administrative Decision: the letter
During the analysis, communication policy has been established for and about(!) the solution(s). Here the connection is made with the way in which this has been processed in fixed and/or free text(s) for all test scenarios.
