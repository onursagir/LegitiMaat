# Legal Perspective Questionnaire

The central question in the legal perspective:

Is the automatically execution in accordance with the legislation it aims to execute, the principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination?

## Act and legislation 
1. Does the relevant legislation leave room to exercise discretionary powers? 
2. Does this legislation contain a hardship clause?
3. Does the public agency formalise and publish internal policies / manuals as policies?  
4. Is explicitly determined by legislation which data from other administrative agencies must be used?

## Internal policies / manuals
1. Has it been established how the scope for assessment is to be filled in. Can be determined what the main focus is in and which interests play a role (efficiency / enforcement / service provision / trust in citizens)?
2. If internal policies / manuals are not formalized and published, what is the justification for that?
3. Learning circle: do experiences from the work-floor, telephone calls, errors, internal signals, recommendations from the ombudsman, formal legal responses like objections and complaints, case law, etc. lead to changes in internal policies / manuals or in legislation and regulations?

## Analysis or Functional Design 
1. In what way are relevant sources (like all applicable legislation/regulations and policies) collected?
2. How is the completeness ensured of all collected resources (considering the task that has to be performed?) 
3. Which disciplines are involved in the analysis? To what extent does the analysis or interpretation depend on the person of the analyst, do different analysts arrive at the same interpretation (inter-coder reliability)?
4. Which supporting applications are available for analysis and interpretation of the sources and recording of the results thereof?
5. Are choices in the analysis or interpretation of the sources,  explicitly recorded?
6. Are concepts of other acts interpreted from acts that belong to the domain of other agencies and is the interpretation checked by these authorities? 
7.  Are concrete examples or scenarios created to validate the analysis? 
8. Is in this stage a routine designed for unforeseen/unintended outcomes? (for example, that certain cases are not handled automatically, but manually and is the public servant allowed or expected to overrule the decision support system?)
9. Is in this stage enabled that the citizen is contacted prior to the decision?
10. Is facilitated to use data provided by the citizen itself (a kind of â€˜assertion register/ log' even if the data differ from data in more or less official databases )?
11. Is explicitly documented in what cases a public servant is allowed to make a professional assessment of the case (i.e. enter other data or overrule the system)?
12. Learning circle: do work floor (street level) experiences with the routines ( telephone calls, errors, internal signals) or recommendations from the ombudsman, formal objections and complaints, case law, etc. lead to changes in the analysis?

## Decision Rules
1. Is the translation of legislation, regulations and implementation policy into decision rules readable and understandable?
2. How is the traceability of decision rules to their (legal) sources documented?
3. Are the principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination taken into consideration when the decision rules are written?
4. Are the decision rules tested to ensure that the decisions are in accordance with the act, principles of good administration and prohibition of discrimination?
5. Are the concrete examples and scenarios from the analysis stage used for validation of the decision rules?
6. Is the automated execution by the IT systems based on the decision rules that in return were made on the basis of the analysis of legal sources?
7. How is determined which decisions are (partly) taken manually?
8. What factors determine if a decision is selected as hard case and how are the principles of good administration and the prohibition of discrimination incorporated?
9. Are the decision rules used for both automated and manual decisions (work instructions)?
10. Are the decision rules used for both the initial decisions and decisions made in formal legal procedures?
11. Are the decision rules published internally and externally? If they are only published internally, what is the justification for keeping them internal? If the decision rules are public, where and how are they published?

## Code
1. Is the code automatically generated from the decision rules or are people used to get from decision rules to code?
2. How are indirect or hidden execution policies in the code prevented? Is there a routine to go back to policy makers or the legislator if it appears during coding that further interpretation or interpretation is necessary?
3. How is the code tested/evaluated for compliance with the decision rules? Which experts and disciplines are involved?
4. Can the code be traced back to the legal source?

## Digital interaction
1. Can citizens change data themselves?
2. Is the interaction based on the decision rules?
3. What is the result of the digital interaction?

## Administrative Decision: the letter
1. Is the decision directly and exclusively based on the code, which in turn is based on the decision rules?
2. If a citizen (recipient of the decision) wants to know what the decision and calculation rules are in order to dispute the decision, how is she informed ?
3. Does the decision explicitly refer to the automated process and the underlying logic? 
4. Is the motivation correct?
5. Is it clear how citizens can contact the public administration?

## Reaction citizen
1. Can the citizen (recipient of the decision) informally, ie without filing a formal objection, get in touch with a human public servant about the decision?
2. Does the public organisation has insight and an overview of all reactions from recipients of the decisions?

## Chain effects
1. Has been documented which agencies ('third-party decision recipients') are informed about the decision and how (data exchange /referral index/ access to databases)?
2. Is the decision already exchanged (as data) while it has not yet been legally finalized and can therefore be annulled? 
3. When the decision is changed retroactively (due to the annulment of a decision), how is ensured that third-party decision recipients are notified? (and act upon it?)
